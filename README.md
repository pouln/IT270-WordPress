# IT270 CMS with WordPress Summer 20222

The BIG PICTURE - PART ONE - You will learn to create a WordPress site from scratch in seven weeks!

From the "get-go," you must have (or know, or do) the following:

    A solid understanding of HTML and CSS means you know how to build a website FROM SCRATCH - no copying and pasting another student/instructor's work.  Let me repeat that: No copying and pasting another student's/instructor's HTML and CSS*
    You understand how to FTP your files using Filezilla, Cyberduck, or WinSCP, NOT just uploading your files via your hosting company's dashboard.
    Server space.  You have purchased server space from one of the many hosting companies!
    You will be dedicating a minimum of 15 - 20 hours per week to this class
    You will use the following folder/file structure - your world in my class will exist in your it270 folder.  If it is not in your it270 folder, it does not exist, equating to a grade of "0" (no subdomains)
        yourdomainname.com/it270/site1   = Our Travel Website
        yourdomainname.com/it270/final = Your Final Project
        yourdomainname.com/it270/company = Our Multisite project  

 
The BIG PICTURE - PART TWO

From the "get-go," TWO WordPress Installations (by the end of Week 2):

    First WordPress Installation on your local server environment - I use MAMP (for Macs and PCs) in class. The WordPress installation on your local server environment provides you a place on your computer to practice with WordPress.  Don't forget, PRACTICE MAKES PROGRESS AND EVEN PERFECTION!
        You can use XAMPP
    Second WordPress Installation on your server (i.e., GoDaddy, BlueHost, HostGator, Dreamhost, etc.)

 
The BIG PICTURE - PART THREE

Two more WordPress Installations:

    Your final project (on your server)
    Muli-site project (on your server)
